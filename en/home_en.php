<h2>A few words about the PhD Student Conference</h2>
<p>
Since 1993, <strong>the STEP'UP doctoral school has organized the “Congrès Des Doctorants” (CDD)</strong>, 
a yearly conference to promote the research of PhD students from the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP), 
the University Paris Diderot (UPD), the École Normale Supérieure (ENS) and the University Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC). 
The congress is organised by the 1st year PhD students from both 
components of the doctoral school (Environment Sciences and the Physics of the Universe) and will feature vulgarization talks
from reseachers along with posters and presentations from Ph.D. students of STEP'UP and other invited students.
The goal of this conference is to establish links between students, researchers and professionals in the geosciences and physics of the universe fields. 
The <strong>2022 edition will be held at IPGP between 13 and 15 April.</strong></p>
