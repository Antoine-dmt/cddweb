<h2>A few words about the PhD Student Conference</h2>
<p>
Since 1993, <strong>the STEP'UP doctoral school has organized the “Congrès Des Doctorants” (CDD)</strong>, 
a yearly conference to promote the research of PhD students from the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP), 
the University Paris Diderot (UPD), the École Normale Supérieure (ENS) and the University Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC). 
This congress features posters presentations from 1st and 2nd year PhD students, and talks from 3rd year PhD students 
and foreign students from other European universities. The congress is organised by the 1st year PhD students from both 
components of the doctoral school (Environment Sciences and the Physics of the Universe). This vastly increases the scope 
of the scientific topics covered and illustrates the interdisciplinary of the STEP’UP doctoral school. 
The goal of this conference is to establish links between students, researchers and professionals in the geosciences and physics of the universe fields. 
The <strong>2020 edition will be held exceptionally at IPGP on 29 and 30 October.</strong></p>
