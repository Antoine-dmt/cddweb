<h4>Some advice for a scientific poster:</h4>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you use Adobe Illustrator, please vectorise all text (select all, Text Menu → Vectorize) before saving in PDF format.
        </li>
        <li>
            If your file size is above 75 Mo, it is possible to reduce it without loosing quality with Acrobat Professional (Documents → Reduce file size).
        </li>
        <li>
            Please favour one sans-serif font (e.g. Helvetica, Arial) with its different styles (e.g. bold, italic) to have better readability.
        </li>
        <li>
            The poster must be clearly readable at a distance of 2m (exclude text bellow 18pt).
        </li>		
    </ul>
